- **189 real interview questions** ranging from fundamentals to advanced algorithmic challenges  
- **Step-by-step solution walkthroughs** to help you understand the reasoning process  
- **Interview-style hints** for every question, simulating a real interview experience  
- **Five proven strategies** for tackling unfamiliar algorithm problems  
- **In-depth coverage of core CS topics**, including:
  - Big-O time and space complexity  
  - Data structures  
  - Core algorithms  
- **Insights into hiring processes** at top companies like Google and Facebook  
- **Behavioral interview preparation**, including soft skills and communication techniques  
- **Guidance for interviewers**, covering what makes a strong interview question and hiring process  

## Purpose of This Repo

This repository serves as:
- A **practice companion** while working through the book  
- A **reference for solutions and explanations**  
- A **structured revision resource** for technical interview preparation
